# War-Card-Game
I created the card game War with C#

The Cards folder has a CardDeck class which I use to populate a deck in my program. It also has methods to shuffle the deck, and so on.

In the HovlandWarGame folder I have two files. 
Program.cs runs the game and handles user input. 
War.cs handles the logic of shuffling, drawing cards, comparing them, and assigning scores to each player.
